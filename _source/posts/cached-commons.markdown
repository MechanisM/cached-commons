Cached Commons is a collection of user-contributed javascript libraries that have been cached, optimized, and hosted on Github's fast CDN.  If a library is missing from this collection, "post a request on Github":http://github.com/viatropos/cached-commons/issues and we'll add it immediately.  The "readme":/readme has all the details.
